    "description": "Gabrer the Deadly was once a builder of peace beneath emerald skies - a towering leader who shaped homes with his hands and settled disputes with his voice. But when a rift tore through reality, casting the Ape Kin into the crimson wilds of the Land of Red, Gabrer was forced to become something else. To protect his people, he crushed a tyrant in ritual combat - and inherited his name. Now, as Blood of Ape and a member of the feared Blood 10, Gabrer commands with strength sharpened by sorrow, wisdom forged in exile, and a will that never forgot the world they lost. Behind the fury burns the memory of who he was - and the hope of who his kin might become.\nBrace.\n\nParadox #8302\nEvolved from Glasgrind The Deadly",
