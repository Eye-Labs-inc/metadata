    "description": "Kranix the Deadly, known as The Tempered Fury, was once a master carpenter in the emerald treetops - his massive hands famed for creation, not destruction. But when the Ape Kin were cast into the Land of Red, a hidden rage awakened within him. Forging the Fury Division, Kranix taught his warriors to wield their fury like a craftsman's blade - measured, purposeful and precise. His philosophy balanced creation with combat, instilling discipline through acts of building before battle. Feared for his power, respected for his restraint, Kranix stands as a symbol of duality - raging warrior, devoted maker - forever shaping the Blood of Ape legacy.\nBrace.\n\nParadox #8212\nEvolved from Grazoks Dreadfoot",
